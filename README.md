##A JavaScript Memory Game for the third Udacity Project

The aim of this project was to create a matching game in JavaScript. There was some HTML and CSS code provided, like the global structure of the HTML and the disposition of the cards, as well as the background image. This code could be modified as we please.

##Logic of the game
The player must find the similar cards. There are 16 cards. If the player finishes with 10 moves or less, he will receive 3 stars (the whole score). But if the player needs 20 moves, he will receive only two stars. For the other cases, only one star. The time is not a fundamental factor for the whole score, but it is displayed at the end of the game. 

##Materials used
There was some HTML and CSS code provided, like the global structure of the HTML and the disposition of the cards, as well as the background image. This code could be modified as we please.
For the animations of the cards, these two links were helpful: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_animation_flip_in_y.htm` and from here: `https://memory-game-fend.herokuapp.com/#

##Installation requirements
There are no installations needed, only a well-functioning browser, higher than IE 9.
